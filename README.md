**Unlock the full potential of single-cell RNA sequencing data with a robust, reproducible, and scalable analysis workflow.**  

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our ability to study cellular heterogeneity, gene regulation, and developmental trajectories at unprecedented resolution. However, analyzing these complex datasets requires rigorous quality control, sophisticated statistical methods, and computational reproducibility. This pipeline addresses these challenges head-on by integrating **state-of-the-art tools** and **best practices** for end-to-end scRNA-seq analysisâ€”from raw sequencing reads to annotated cell clusters.

## Why This Pipeline?
- **Rigorously Validated QC**: Automated detection of low-quality cells, ambient RNA, and doublets using tools like `SoupX` and `Scrublet`.
- **Reproducible & Scalable**: Built with Nextflow and Docker/Singularity for seamless deployment across laptops, HPCs, and cloud platforms.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Leverages cutting-edge methods like `SCTransform` for normalization, `Harmony` for batch correction, and `SingleR` for cell-type annotation.
- **Benchmark-Ready**: Compare results against public references (e.g., Human Cell Atlas) and validate clusters biologically.

**Key Workflow Steps**:  
1. Raw read QC and trimming  
2. Alignment/quantification (STAR/Alevin)  
3. Cell/gene filtering (adaptive MAD thresholds)  
4. Doublet detection and ambient RNA correction  
5. Normalization, clustering, and annotation  
6. Interactive HTML reports and publication-ready plots  

**Designed For**:  
- Researchers analyzing 10x Genomics, Drop-seq, or Smart-seq2 data  
- Bioinformaticians seeking reproducibility in collaborative projects  
- Core facilities needing standardized workflows
